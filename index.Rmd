## Overview - update Introduction

The United States has one of the highest maternal mortality rate out of developed countries despite high levels of spending. What are the underlying reasons for this? According to the CDC, Maternal Mortality Ratio is defined as the number of pregnancy-related deaths per 100,000 live births in a certain period of time. The CDC reports that in 2016 alone, the US had 16.8 deaths per 100,000 live births compared to 8.6 in the UK. The UK seems to have achieved these results while spending half than what the US spends in healthcare. As a team, we are interested in assessing the maternal mortality ratio against different determining factors to try to understand why the US lags behind other developed nations on this front.
